This license applies to the materials not licensed otherwise.
In particular, it does NOT apply to the non-commercial-use .obj meshes
to the GPL'ed Sunfish chess engine, or most of the python scripts not
by Alexander Pruss.

I have tried to mark files or directories with the most accurate licensing
or copyright credits that I could, but please let me know if I missed
something. (Just put it in the project bug tracker.)
